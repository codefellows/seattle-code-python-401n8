## Overview

DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams. It emphasizes team empowerment, cross-team communication and collaboration, and technology automation. (Source: atlassian.com)

Python is a powerful language that can be used to automate many DevOps processes. Python's ease of use and extensive standard library make it ideal for writing scripts to automate routine tasks. This can include anything from data cleanup and validation to the automatic generation of reports.

As a developer, if you find yourself doing the same manual steps repeatedly then stop for a second and think if the upfront cost of automation could pay off.

## How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In the previous class we learned about crytopgraphy.

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we'll be building a CLI application to automate some DevOps tasks with Python.

**Where we're headed**:
Next class we will be kicking off Midterm Project Week!

### Why

- DevOps is a great example of automation in Python.
- Learn how to build well styled CLI apps with [Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich)
- Automation is cool and Python makes it easy and fun!

### What

- **Automation**: A system of controlling a process by highly automatic means, reducing human intervention to a minimum. In software, this often refers to scripts or programs that perform tasks without needing human input.
- **DevOps**: A set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.
- **CLI application**: A command-line interface (CLI) application is a program that is controlled entirely through a user typing commands, and it doesn't have a graphical interface.
- **Python Standard Library**: A collection of modules and packages that Python provides out of the box. These tools provide functionality for a wide variety of programming tasks and are an integral part of Python as a language.
- **Python's `re` module**: A module in the Python Standard Library that provides functionality for working with regular expressions. Regular expressions are a powerful tool for pattern matching and parsing in strings.
- **Python's `os` module**: A module in the Python Standard Library that provides a way of using operating system dependent functionality such as reading or writing to the environment, interacting with files and directories, and getting information on the process.
- **Python's `shutil` module**: A module in the Python Standard Library that provides a number of high-level operations on files and collections of files, including copying, moving, deleting and archiving.

### How

- Build a CLI application in Python
- Style the app with Rich
- Add automation features to the app using the Standard Library
- Read documentation
